# Spiders-and-Caves
A simple game that I created. It is a basic turn RPG that I used to train my Dev skills. I think that I don't done a really good balance at the enemies in the game. I spent a hole week on this project.

So, in the game we have all the base attributes:

VIT - is your Vitality, this number times 3 will be your base Health Points.
INT - is your Intelligence, this number times 2 will be your base Mana Points.
STR - is your Strength, this number plus the damage from your physical abilities will be the real damage.
WIN - is your Windsom, this number plus the damage from your magical abilities will be the actual damage.
DEF - is your Defense, when you take damage this number will decrease the damage (You will always take 1 damage in any attack).
SPE - is your Speed, the fastest acts first.
DEX - is your Dexterity, it is your chance to avoid an attack.
CRT - is your critical chance, is your chance for your attack to do double damage.

Poison deals 1 damage.
Burn deals 2 damage.
